# Updated script for interview

The learning opportunities from this project are a story in itself. I went from having no experience in command line programs to being fully comfortable using the Terminal within 72 hours. This coding assignment challenged me and allowed me to learn and grow.

This folder contains another script that takes a slightly modified approach and contains a small yet vital correction.

1. It uses pandas chunks instead of a dask dataframe for processing.  
2. It correctly outputs a new CSV file to ```stdout``` instead of writing directly to a CSV file.

To run this script please use the following:
```shell
python script.py input_file.csv input_file.csv input_file.csv > output_file.csv
```
