# PMG_Challenge

Here is my repository containing the Coding Challenge for PMG's Graduate Leadership Program.

It contains a requirements file, three sample CSV files, my script (combine.py), and the sample combined CSV file (combined.csv).

***To run the script, please use the following format:*** 
```shell 
python script.py inputFile.csv inputFile.csv inputFile.csv outputFile.csv
```
Taking on this challenge was a great pleasure. I look forward to the opportunity to present my ideas and learn where to improve.
